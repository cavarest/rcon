== Quick Start

=== Purpose

Send your first RCON command in under 5 minutes.

=== Basic Usage

Create an `RconClient` and send a command:

[source,java]
----
import io.cavarest.rcon.RconClient;
import io.cavarest.rcon.RconResponse;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the client
        RconClient client = RconClient.builder()
            .host("localhost")
            .port(25575)
            .password("your_password")
            .build();

        // Send a command
        RconResponse response = client.sendCommand("list");

        // Print the response
        System.out.println("Response: " + response.getResponse());

        // Close when done
        client.close();
    }
}
----

=== Expected Output

[source]
----
Response: There are 5 out of max 20 players online:
Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5
----

=== What's Happening?

1. **Client Creation** - The `RconClient.Builder` configures connection parameters
2. **Authentication** - The client automatically authenticates on first use
3. **Command Execution** - The command is sent and response is received
4. **Multi-Packet Handling** - Large responses are automatically assembled (you don't need to do anything!)
