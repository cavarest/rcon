== Core Concepts

=== Purpose

Deep dive into the internal architecture and design decisions of Rcon.

=== Topics

* link:fragment-resolution/index.html[Fragment Resolution] - How multi-packet responses are handled
* link:thread-safety/index.html[Thread Safety Model] - Concurrent command execution
* link:packet-protocol/index.html[Packet Protocol] - Binary encoding details
* link:byte-order/index.html[Byte Order] - Little-endian encoding
* link:buffer-management/index.html[Buffer Management] - I/O buffer strategies
* link:charset-handling/index.html[Charset Handling] - Text encoding for color codes

=== Architecture

Rcon follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

. **High-Level API** (`RconClient`) - User-friendly interface with logging
. **Core API** (`Rcon`) - Thread-safe protocol implementation
. **I/O Layer** (`PacketReader`/`PacketWriter`) - Socket operations
. **Codec Layer** (`PacketCodec`) - Binary encoding/decoding
. **Domain Model** (`Packet`) - Immutable packet representation

Each layer has a single responsibility and can be used independently if needed.

=== Design Principles

* **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Java standard library
* **Immutability** - `Packet` objects are immutable
* **Thread Safety** - Safe concurrent access via synchronized methods
* **Separation of Concerns** - Clear layer boundaries
* **Configurability** - Pluggable strategies and options

=== Performance Characteristics

* **Minimal Allocation** - Buffers are reused via `compact()`
* **Lock-Free Counter** - `AtomicInteger` for request IDs
* **Efficient Encoding** - Direct buffer manipulation
* **Smart Fragment Resolution** - Default strategy minimizes round-trips
